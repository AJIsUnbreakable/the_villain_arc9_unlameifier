Steel has a notable issue of sticking to the chamber wall due to carbon buildup. Not only this, steel does not expand the same way as brass and thus does not reliably seal. Both of these issues cause stoppages.

Don't worry. It's not all bad though. You get some pretty exaggerated recoil reduction to offset the disadvantages.]]
